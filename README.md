# Football Match Tracker âš½

A simple Scala program to record and manage football (soccer) match results. The system models matches between clubs and tracks their performance through a small, testable structure.

## Overview

This project includes three main components:

- **Club**: Represents a football club, with its name and statistics.
- **Match**: Represents a football match between two clubs, recording goals and determining the outcome.
- **MatchTest**: An application object used to test the behavior and interaction of the `Club` and `Match` classes.

## How It Works

- Each `Match` is associated with two `Club` instances.
- After a match is played, results (goals scored) are used to determine:
  - Win/loss/draw status
  - Club performance metrics (e.g., points)
- `MatchTest` runs a few example matches and outputs the results for inspection.
